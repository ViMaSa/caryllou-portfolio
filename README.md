# Caryl Lou Paayas - Graphic Designer Portfolio Page V1
Site is hosted on github pages. This can be transferred to a custom website link once provided.
Link: https://vimasa.github.io/caryllou-portfolio/

# What could I improve the next time?
- Create standard css across all pages before coding and following them instead of creating/adding css as I create each page.
- Start with unit testing first for components/link redirection

# Concepts I've learned creating this portfolio page:
- Take mock designs given to me by Caryllou and bring it to life: https://xd.adobe.com/view/ea0b3d61-66e8-4dd3-81d6-433f41a65a8e-bf58/screen/9e12e93b-0e1a-4dac-bb13-977c33e51dda
  - Mobile first design
  - Ensure site is responsive

- Learned how to deploy/host on Github Pages
- Learned CSS animations
- Imported fonts through google fonts & downloaded font file
- Created modal for menu bars & link to different "pages"(components)
- Refactor footer, project columns, and SCSS to follow Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle

- Learned how to use hashrouter:
  - Using layout to persist the navigation bar

- Imported image assets using an index.js file and only importing images based on each "page" (component) being rendered:
  - Image sizing based on window screen size

- Unit Testing:
  - Learned to use global function in Jest unit tests (renderWithRouter)
  - Test for correct route landing page and incorrect landing page
  - Also still in progress...

### Note - Able to email Caryllou when clicking the email button but she does not have social media links for her Instagram and other socials yet.
